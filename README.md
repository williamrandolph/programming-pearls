# programming-pearls

I'm working through Jon Bentley's Programming Pearls, 2nd Edition, and
am putting my work into this repo as I go. I'm not going exercise by
exercise. Rather, as I write bits of code that seem complete or
interesting, I'm adding them to the repo.

* bitvector.py - This is my work for the first column. I'm trying to
  get stronger with Python, so I used the doctest module perhaps a little
  too much. I like feeling like I'm doing literate programming, though
  the docstring locations feel a little artificial for an essay-like flow.
